# Installation

    $ npm install --save that # duh

It works in browsers too (tested in Chrome), just include the index.js

# Usage

Just use the keyword `that`, it's that simple.

# How that works

It adds a property to the global object (whatever that is) called `that` with a getter that returns a new random variable every time it's read.

# IE support

Only NodeJS and actual browsers are supported
